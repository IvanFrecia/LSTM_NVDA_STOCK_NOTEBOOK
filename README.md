# Customer Churn Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook explores a dataset of customer information to predict customer churn.  Churn, in this context, refers to customers who have stopped using a service or product. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and improve their services.

## Overview

This notebook performs the following tasks:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loads the customer churn dataset and performs initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). This includes examining data types, descriptive statistics, and identifying potential data quality issues.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data for modeling. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
4.  **Model Selection:** Explores different machine learning models suitable for binary classification (churn/no churn).
5.  **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trains the selected models on the preprocessed data and evaluates their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
6.  **Model Interpretation:** Analyzes the trained model to understand which features are most important in predicting churn.
7. **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Summarizes the findings and provides recommendations for reducing customer churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook contains information about customers, including:

*   **Demographic Information:** Age, gender, location, etc.
*   **Service Usage:** Length of service, types of services used, etc.
*   **Account Information:** Contract type, payment method, monthly charges, etc.
*   **Churn Status:** A binary indicator (yes/no) indicating whether the customer has churned.

*(Note: If you are using a specific dataset, replace this with the actual dataset description.)*

## Libraries Used

This notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:

*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
*   **Seaborn:** For enhanced data visualization.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
*   **Other libraries:** (Add any other libraries you use, e.g., `statsmodels`, `xgboost`, etc.)

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone [repository_url]` (If applicable)
2.  **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (If you have a `requirements.txt` file)
3.  **Open the notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb` file.
4.  **Run the cells:** Execute the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Findings


*   **Example:** Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
*   **Example:** High monthly charges are correlated with higher churn rates.
*   **Example:** The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 0.85.

## Future Work


*   **Example:** Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques.
*   **Example:** Experiment with different machine learning models, such as deep learning models.
*   **Example:** Deploy the trained model as a web service for real-time churn prediction.
* **Example:** Implement A/B testing to test the impact of different churn reduction strategies.
